# Materialized-portfolio

I am not sure if I can use materialize webpage template as my resume but I really like how it looks. If I can use materialize without any copyright issues then I plan to add more features into my portfolio such as jump.js so people can click on my navbar buttons and it'll auto scroll down to my desired location instead of scrolling by themselves.
